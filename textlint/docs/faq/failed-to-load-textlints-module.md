## Error messages

## Solution A

Maybe, you have installed `textlint` and rules into different place.

- If you have installed `textlint` as `--global`(`-g`), must install each rule as `--global`.
- If you have installed `textlint` as `--save-dev`(`-D`), must install each rule as `--save-dev`.

## Solution B

1. Update `textlint` and the rule and preset, plugin.
2. Check your `.textlintrc` option value. 

**1**: This error is caused by mismatch between `textlint` and the other(rule and preset, plugin).

**2**: This error is caused by invalid config value.

- Check the rule name in `.textlintrc` and `package.json`

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "foo" : true
    }
}
```

In the cause, have to installed `textlint-rule-foo` module via `npm install textlint-rule-foo`.

When the module is missing in `node_modules`, textlint throw this error.
